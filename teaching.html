		<h2>Evaluation</h2>
		<div class="person">
			<p>"Rumela Sen has definitely been one of my favorite professors at Columbia. I was amazed by her knowledge about India at both a local or state level and also about India on the global stage. She is definitely a great resource outside of the classroom when it comes to asking for advice on research papers. I would recommend her as a professor."</p>
			<p><em>- Anonymous, Rate My Professor</em></p>
		</div>
		<div class="person">
			<p>"Professor Sen is extremely knowledgable in her field, as well as a passionate educator. She is very flexible, willing to talk with students and change her class/teaching style accordingly, as well as provide individual feedback. Professor Sen is a great lecturer, and provides context for her arguments that makes them easy to follow."</p>
